AUTOMATED BUGGY DESIGN PROJECT | Arduino programming, Circuit Design and Simulation, PCB design            
2023 ODDSEM              
• Designed automated buggy which could move by detecting the path using sensor modules and even     
   by giving commands using Xbee module.
   
• Worked on CAD Tools to design, simulate and Design PCB of sensor modules such as IR sensors, 
   Ultrasonic sensor, receiver and transmitter modules.
   
• Learned to use Xbee module and worked with ATmega328p microcontroller for buggy design.
